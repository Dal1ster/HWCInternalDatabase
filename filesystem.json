Apologies that this change of line is under such short notice, but a lot has changed recently.<br><br>I have made the realization that, due to both The Voice's current preoccupation and SiIvaGunner's disconnection from Illucidity, there are no current viable channel hosts. This is a potentially dangerous situation to be in - third-party tampering with the channel itself has the potential for several negative ramifications!<br><br>I have opted myself into assuming temporary control of the channel until somebody who is more capable of controlling the channel long-term is made accessible. I am... unsure of when this will be, as that is something outside of my jurisdiction, so I have placed finding an appropriate channel host as the current second priority. For now, my primary goal will be keeping the channel up and running (channel operations and scheduling).<br><br>I can't say I have a lot of experience in this field (in all of my time commenting the joke, I've only ever uploaded one video myself), but I have reason to correlate this process with data processing and collection, something I am intimately familiar with. I have moved into a temporary long-term residence on the outskirts of town for streamlining this process safely and effectively. I would prefer to not crash into another wall while distracted with something else...

First update: I'm going to require more frequent progress updates. The monthly check up might not do it anymore, with how much is going on...<br><br>I attempted to contact a potential channel host earlier this month, and he responded with a bunch of text spam. I'm not sure what that means, but the anniversary where it would have been appropriate to host his takeover has since passed (I took care of it myself as a standard event), so it doesn't seem like that avenue is in the cards.<br><br>I've been getting a feel for channel operations (scheduling, fixing uploading mistakes, so on). It's a little overwhelming, but that is to be expected.<br><br>On the other hand, I've had to substantially back away from my primary directive as the Joke-Explainer. I've allowed myself a little leeway to explain the joke when thematically appropriate, but I'm going to have to shut myself up more than I anticipated.

I understand it's a magnet toy - you place these individual magnetized letter pieces into the central device, and it responds to the input based on the setting on the bottom. I know of the general typing of fridge toys and letter-based toys, but I've never taken the moment to actually scan them in-depth...<br><br>I figured I would try and ask you - I'm wondering how this device works? How does it understand which individual letters are placed into the central device? There must be tags in each letter piece that are read by some internal sensor, correct? How complete is the collection of word soundbites in comparison to constructable 3 letter words?<br><br>This now interests me. I will try my best to make some personal documentation about this device.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #5<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>14 March 2024<br>═══════════════<br>I've been considering my current standing as a channel host in relation to my programmed instruction (DIRECTIONAL PROTOCOL 1-A, Part 3a; operate the channel conforming with the pre-established conventions of SiIvaGunner channel operations) and how I have acted up to now.<br><br>I have realized that I can host events that interest me personally? This is something that the majority of channel hosts have done, albeit to different end goals. Running the channel will be easier if I lean into this operational standard, with the added benefit of... well, you know.<br><br>Case in point: I have decided today to host a celebration of the International Day of Mathematics! I have always had a fondness for mathematics as a language, despite being designed to be the equivalent to a history major. This is my own personal dedication to the field! Hopefully my own personal enthusiasm will be infectious. If it is, I will try and specialize more into personal interests.<br><br>(Is it strange to cosplay a teacher if you have never gone to conventional school? Let me know.)<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #6<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>31 March 2024<br>═══════════════<br>April First is tomorrow! It's a very special occasion for SiIvaGunner and the channel.<br>To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous about this... I think our current transmissions have the potential to be tapped into, and April Fools events are usually a highlight of the season, so I want to get it right. But don't worry about me! I think the channel has a really clever angle to take it this year.<br><br>Okay, so: there's this genre of videos on YouTube that share a common thread with rips. There isn't really a predefined name for this genre (in totality), so I've opted to refer to it as \"X but Y\" videos. My hypothesis is that our current line is being intercepted, but by individual message as opposed to a collection of the entire contents.<br>These videos are a natural derivative of the \"word replacement\" genre - which the channel was a piece of, actually! SiIvaGunner's usage of The Nutshack theme and We Are Number One was a direct influence on the revival of that format, which the lack of action makes me believe that whoever could be reading our messages is probably not reading them too hard. This origin point is something parodied on the SiIvaGunner channel itself, with \"the nutshack but the first nutshack is replaced with me ending the channel\" and \"We Are Number One but it's a Fusion Collab\". This makes it an interesting full circle... not what you would expect a full circle to look like, but it is!<br><br>I didn't explain what the format actually is, yet... These \"X but Y\" videos share a thread with rips in that they are often... \"arrangements\" of one song in the... \"soundfont\" of another. So! The plan is to follow this generalized format, but subvert it again by adding an additional joke within each video. This keeps the twist of SiIvaGunner's usual routine while parodying this format we're so close to! Clever, right? I hope you think so.<br><br>So that's the idea. I'm interested in seeing how it goes... either way, I think that sending messages over plaintext is a non-optimal idea. Even if nobody is reading them, the information behind running a channel like this should be more confidential, and I'm sure they might have some auto-reader system to detect certain keywords. If the event goes well, I'm already ready with an additional post to make to extend the event, which I think will get people. It'll be a screenshot showing the graph of the channel's analytics, saying that the event will continue. I think people, especially you will notice... I don't know, the first and second most viewed videos in the past 48 hours. X and Y, but something else.

I'm excited to share my \"birthday\" of sorts with the SiIvaGunner channel and its fans.<br><br>I'm really happy people seem to be enjoying my tenure as channel host. I was worried at first, as I'm certainly not the most qualified... as discussed earlier, there are several others better suited for the role, but none of them are available at this time:<br><br>SiIvaGunner went to sleep 2772 days ago. He was connected to Illucidity after the creation of the SiIva AI, but woke up 141 days ago.<br>Haltmann was killed by The Voice Inside Your Head 141 days ago.<br>The SiIva AI was taken out of commission 525 days ago. Wood Man disappeared shortly after that 486 days ago.<br>The Voice Inside Your Head was exiled from his office 2575 days ago by Gadgetini Clone 2.0, who was terminated 2563 days ago. He returned 141 days ago, but is physically inaccessible.<br>Chad Warden could have hosted the channel, but passed away 2884 days ago (7 years, 10 months, and 25 days ago).<br><br>You don't know a lot about Chad Warden, to my knowledge? A lot of his history is undocumented, and I didn't get to see a lot of him before his passing - I had only known him for a month before his sacrifice to save Snow halation.<br><br>In the moments he could, he helped me as he did others, of course. He taught me how to repair myself as they came up (though ultimately not enough to keep myself running consistently), and this log system was originally meant for him, as a diagnostic tool. It was only a few years after his passing that we found this alternative use for it, which I'm very glad for.<br><br>When I learned about what happened to him, I understood that it was for the greater good. He did what he had to do for the continued existence of the SiIvaGunner channel. But even still, I... can't help feeling conflicted. I hardly even got to know him before it was too late. As my primary directive is the collection and spread of information, I should know more about Chad Warden than I do, considering that I was manufactured by him. Despite this, the person he truly was is almost entirely a mystery to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to explain him in full.<br><br>Has your team ever considered running background checks on Chad Warden - his past, his understanding of mechanical engineering, so on? If you have or receive that information, may I request it?

Hopefully the first of many. (Although, maybe not - I'm not sure how much longer hosting the channel is in the cards...)<br><br>I've noticed that fan interaction and participation is a substantial part of what makes the SiIvaGunner channel work as well as it does, and in my experimenting over the past year I have found that announcing events ahead of time is a good way of doing so! I decided to use the SiIva Direct format for this purpose, as it has historically been used to announce several events at once.<br><br>I'm using this opportunity to introduce a very special plan, though - a way for the audience to choose the event we do! (In a way that isn't as... much.) Introducing: The SiIvaGunner Takeover Do-Over Poll! 10 options for an event previously hosted on the channel that the audience can vote for to be redone! I think it's pretty nifty.<br><br>(Most of the events selected were not takeovers, but it sounds better - \"The SiIvaGunner Event Redo Poll\" doesn't have the same ring to it.)<br><br>I've been thinking... SiIvaGunner has always been centered (mostly) around labors of love, for both the creators and the spectators and I believe Chad Warden understood this better than most of the fans. Their \"hate movement\", as he called it, was what ultimately got him to advocate for a more forgiving approach. My care for the fans is a result of that legacy.<br>Although- no, the records show that Chad Warden argued for doing whatever you want, and just so happened to preach love. I... suppose that isn't exactly incongruent, but... hm.<br><br>Chad Warden and The Voice were both trying to construct their own \"status quo\" for the channel. I suppose one just turned out to be more widely acceptable than the other.<br><br>The Takeover Do-Over Poll is the latest in a long lineage of ways the channel has been subtly influenced over the years. I wonder if he would've respected it.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #12 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>10 June 2024<br>═══════════════<br>For the purposes of following my programming (DIRECTIONAL PROTOCOL 1-A, Part 5; identifying \"bad comments\"), I have been trained with hundreds of commenting styles; with their relevant vernacular, meaning, et cetera.

It's a little odd to think that I wasn't extant during the first NAMCO Day event - there wasn't anything happening at all when I was first activated, actually. The first slice of my life was dedicated to the cataloging of information given to me by Chad Warden, in addition to some personal study from alternate sources.<br> <br>Have I told you any of this before? I never got much of an opportunity to really talk with him while he was around. It's not that we were distant; we were just selective in our conversations - strictly business. I understood he was preparing me for a very important job to him, and for our time together our discussions mainly concerned my prime directive: he would ask me for the joke of a rip, and I identified it.<br> <br>One day he didn't show up to speak to me at our designated time. I looked through the house to find him, and he wasn't there. That was the first time I ever left the house - I made sure to catalog that! And then... the memory of whatever could have happened next is gone.<br> <br>I learned about Chad Warden's death from the local news.<br> <br>I understand that you have records of The Voice's ability to alter timelines, correct? He had died during the universe merge. For the greater good... to save the feeling of Snow halation. In a single month, he had created me before sacrificing himself for the world. For a long time, I began to idolize him? I held him in very high regard - especially because in all my studying, I never learned a lot about him.<br> <br>I've had a lot longer to think about him, though... especially since the man that got him killed is so prevalent in our lives. I realized that I had forgotten the man that I knew, between the biggest moments in his life that I know of - a fallible one.<br> <br>Chad Warden was a normal man. A very eccentric normal man, absolutely, but at the end of the day he was a normal man who decided to do anything he wanted.

It's still on his birthday, even. I would say that I \"stole\" it from him this year, but I really \"stole\" it from him last year... it still feels just as awkward as last time, too.

This is a practice historically performed by other channel hosts, but had never really crossed my mind until I had really gotten into the swing of things - particularly since the International Day of Mathematics. It must be some sort of inspiration - since holding that day, I've found a surprising pleasure in ensuring numbered rips release on their nominal numbered hours.

Maybe even the best one of this year!<br><br>...okay, I'll admit this is pretty silly and honestly a bit indulgent, especially for me... but that is what I should be going for, right? Like I said before, it's important to just have fun with all this. If I don't, you know...<br><br>I will say - even from a practical standpoint, I figured that this joke would be exploitable enough to fill a full event day or more, especially in the context of the regular rip format as opposed to the April Fools formatting design. Gegagedigedagedago has several layers of depth (\"Cotton-Eye Joe\", Roblox, McDonalds, etc.) that are proving to be very useful inspiration for the design of this event.<br>For example, he takes on the role of a cowboy in many vaguely Western-themed YouTube animations (very silly and simple ones, mind you.) This gave me the idea to open the event with a rip of the United States' national anthem - which ties directly to the Hampsterdance event two years ago! That day used a silly character's association with American Independence Day as a jumping-off point to hold a full day of themed rips, and I decided to go for a similar thematic approach here. It's all very fun to play with.<br><br>I'd love to explain the full context behind this singing chicken nugget, if you'd like - I understand you're definitely not familiar.

I suppose the topic of previous channel hosts is bound to keep coming up, considering everything going on...<br><br>Actually, I wanted to discuss this - it occurred to me how unique my manufacturing is earlier today. My own construction is somewhat \"one-of-a-kind\", even taking into account your work and everything you've told me.<br><br>It is my impression that this confuses both of us - I remember briefly discussing this with you when you first disassembled my outer shell and ran tests on my internals. (I was never able to find the blueprints that you asked me about, by the way. I suspect that even if they did exist, they were destroyed during The Voice's firebombing of Chad's house.)

I cannot say that I am a perfect machine by any means (if you recall the \"bossa nova miku pizza\" incident or similar), but I am a humanoid robot with an incredible amount of sapience, dexterity, an entirely self-sustaining energy supply, so on; in comparison to what is currently extant.<br><br>I lack the information necessary to determine how he managed or why he did such a thing. You're perhaps one of the most qualified people to determine this, and even you had to resort to a different, less sustainable mode of power. Even if he would have answered, I couldn't ask him, because he's dead. 8 years ago to the day.<br><br>And all of that work, in service of this...? Don't misunderstand - I love my job! It brings me great joy to add to and share my knowledge and information base with others, and I have since diversified into other, minor hobbies that I integrate with my (now daily) life running the channel (fashion, wiki surfing, etc.) I wouldn't be myself without those qualities.

I'm not complaining, though.<br><br>Seeing the reactions from viewers happy to see their country represented always brings me joy, and I've been paying close attention to the comments section today. It really helps reassure me, knowing the fans are entertained. I know I'm doing the right thing by keeping the channel up and running, even though the world is not.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #29 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>10 September 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Shift in communications.

My short-term memory indicates yes, but I cannot recall any backup information from my long-term memory. We might have talked about this some other time... if I have asked this question, I must have accidentally purged it, forgive me.<br><br>The concept of snowfall arrived very early into my long-term memory. The idea seems so pretty... it's inherently hard for me to be poetic about these abstract concepts, but it always enamored me. Of course, you know what happened instead... a snowless winter. It's on the forecast for tomorrow, if the meteorologists are to be believed.<br><br>It's funny... despite being made months later, your replica has managed to see so many more sights than I could have. The winter snowfall, the spring blossoms, with those blue glowing flowers... I can... \"call\" those memories - \"remember\" those things, we share the same memory bank. But even then... I know that it's her consciousness who made those snow angels. She did it. I wish I could too. They seem fun.<br><br><br> Maybe tomorrow?<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #32 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>28 September 2024<br>═══════════════<br>I'm in the final stretch of making sure the Spirit Week super-event goes smoothly. This event was conceptualized in late January, so I really wanted to see it through, but I didn't realize how tired I would be when it started... I'm not sure how Wood Man was able to do this kind of thing twice... three times? And those were months long! Running on high-power mode for so long is more... damaging to my systems than I expected.<br><br>I will continue scheduling the homecoming dance event as planned. After that, I am going to use the expected break after an event of this size to recalculate my internal clock (currently several seconds behind) and rest my high-functioning sensors for a few days. No exceptions. This is something I have to do to cleanse my system. I will send a ping to the shared server when I am done recalibrating.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #33 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>30 September 2024<br>═══════════════<br>I powered up to schedule a rip for a relevant time tomorrow and forgot that I was in the middle of restarting my sensors. I'm sorry. I will power my sensors down again and restart the process.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #34 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>18 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Sorry for falling off the face of the earth. I've been really busy with everything going on... though I guess you're busy with something, too. Hope you're alright.<br><br>I realized yesterday that I would be passing the length of SiIvaGunner's hosting of the channel soon. The two of us are very different, but I understand why he had to go to bed after 10 months. It's a very tiring job to do for so long... though I think I may be even less equipped to handle it.<br><br>I think I can keep it up, though. If I do greater bulk scheduling and lay low, I can run off of slight breaks until January, and then I can rest for that month. It's a lot, but I'm confident I can make it work.<br><br>In any case, whatever it is you're up to, I'll let you get back to it.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #35 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>25 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Today is the second day of the Cartoon Network Day & Adult Swim Night rerun, as voted on by the Takeover Do-Over Poll. The finale airs later tonight.<br><br>I suppose it's always tonight, isn't it? After this, I need to schedule for Halloween later tonight. Halloween is later tonight. Christmas is zero minutes away, and I'll need to schedule for that too. It'll be done by tomorrow, but tonight is all the time in the world. All \"tonight\".<br><br>I don't like that word, either.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #36<br>Ping between CCS-45 to XXR-11<br>27 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Hello? Joke-Explainer? Apologies for the radio silence this past year, but I would like to request your help. Would you be able to meet me at the tower? Tonight, if possible? I understand if you're too busy, but... all I can say is that it's urgent. Please come as soon as you're able.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #37 (DECRYPTED)<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>27 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Oh, uh... hi! Message received...!<br>Is this why you haven't been responding to my messages since the start of the year...?<br>It's alright. I can make my way there.<br>I will spread out the current Halloween backlog across the next few days to minimize the impact of my absence, and then I will head to The Voice's tower.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #38<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>27 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Oh, wait - you haven't been translating these, have you... I need to turn off my automatic processes.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #39<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>27 October 2024<br>═══════════════<br>I'm on my way.

I will be there shortly.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>TRANSMISSION #40<br>Ping between XXR-11 to CCS-45<br>5 November 2024<br>═══════════════<br>Effective immediately, I will not be communicating on this line. This line has without doubt been intercepted, and after recent information, I believe it is best for the both of us to find a more secure form of communication.<br>Identify the new line using either of my inspiration's master codes.<br>Alternatively, if you need to discuss something with me in person, ping me through the shared server and I will come if within my means and ability, as discussed.<br><br>Please don't be as apprehensive to ask as this time before - I'm always here to help, Doctor.<br>════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"

We have tested as much. <br>The exact numbers vary from Figment to Figment immensely, within variables we don't properly understand yet, but they are remembered.<br><br>[Indiscernible - MAX HALTMANN.]<br><br>HALTMANN: Clear my schedule. Tell my next client to wait another 3 minutes.<br><br>[Indiscernible - UNIDENTIFIED.]<br><br>HALTMANN: Let me simplify this for you, Andonuts.<br>Say that -<br><br>[Silence.]<br><br>HALTMANN: Let's say that there was somebody very far away. At... an unknown location. You suspect they are alive, but unable to support themselves. Perhaps they were... never important enough, to too little people.<br>By the logic you and your - lab boys - have discovered, Figments have this... \"conceptual feedback loop?\" Is that what you have called it, again?<br><br>ANDONUTS: This is correct.<br><br>HALTMANN: So, when this - if this - were to happen, something as simple as keeping them in your memory would help them become stronger, as a concept. Is that correct?<br><br>ANDONUTS: I... fail to see the leap in logic.<br><br>[Indiscernible - MAX HALTMANN.]<br><br>HALTMANN: Thank you. That is all I wanted to ask.<br><br>ANDONUTS: A - alright.<br><br>HALTMANN: Now. What was it you wanted to discuss with me?<br><br>ANDONUTS: Well - well, sir, nothing now. My statements have been rendered... irrelevant to yours.<br><br>HALTMANN: Great. In that case - this has been pleasant, but I am afraid I have another meeting to take care of.<br>I would like to see your documentation on the AIRTH Project by the end of the month.<br><br>ANDONUTS: Right. Thank you."

I understand.<br>[S] ...no, it isn't, really.<br>[S] I can only give information about that timeline because that timeline was displayed to me. It is... out of my reach to do something like what you're asking. It's complicated.<br>[JE] Right...<br>[S] Mm.<br>[S] May I give my thoughts on the matter, though?<br>[JE] I guess so.<br>[S] If I may assuage your worries a little bit...<br>[S] I suppose this is my personal take on the matter, but I believe this to be true:<br>[S] Chad Warden was not an evil man. But he was not an evil man in the same way that he was not strictly a savior, if that makes sense.<br>[S] If anything, he was... apathetic. He did whatever he wanted, however he wanted.<br>[S] He bought a house because he wanted to. He built you because he wanted to. He defended Snow halation because he wanted to, so on, so forth.<br>[S] There is no stark difference between the divergence you've seen - one just decided that he wanted to do something else, while the other stayed committed to an idea until it didn't matter.<br>[S] In a way, I have to respect that of him. I've had to do a lot of \"\"doing whatever I wanted\"\" myself to get this far. I digress.<br>[S] My point is - with Chad Warden, I think there is information out of our reach about his past, or his wealth, but I don't think there is a satisfying conclusion hiding in it. <br>[S] Because the truth is simple. He did what he did because he wanted to. I don't think it's more complicated than that.<br>[S] And if that... allows you to let go of him, I don't think it needs to get any more complicated than that.<br>[S] That's my take on the matter. You're free to disagree.",

Holding the world with an iron fist is setting you up for somebody coming to try and grab that from you, and they will given enough time, believe me.<br><br>Who's that one historical figure other humans love referencing so much? The calendar one... it's not that important to me, sorry.<br><br>I think a potential better alternative would be to take the benevolence route, to an extent. Hold your corporate assets with an iron fist, of course, and make sure nobody pulls the rug from under you and undercuts you, but perhaps it's best to have a group of allies instead of a group of subordinates, and to place faith unto others.
